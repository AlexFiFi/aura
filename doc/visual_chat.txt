Visual Chat is a feature enabled in only some official Mabinogi servers.
It allows you to draw little images, that are displayed in a chat bubble,
like a chat message.

(1)
First you have to make the client support this feature. This is done by
changing the features.xml, that can be found in the package files.
Actually the full name is features.xml.compiled, since it has been
"encrypted" for quite some time now, to prevent edits. Fortunatelly
someone has created a simple little tool that enables us to do that anyway
easily. For more information, go here:
http://dev.mabinoger.com/forum/index.php/topic/211-feature-settings/
The setting you're looking for is "8a124e66", and all you have to do is to
enable it for your region, or just for every region by default:
Default="G10S2" Enable="" Disable=""

(2)
The second edit required is the addition/edit of the script URL the image
is sent to. This can be found in "data/db/urls.xml". Look for your local,
for example:
Locale="usa"
and check if there's a "UploadVisualChatPage" parameter. If there is,
edit it, if not, add it. The URL that goes here depends on where you put
your image script. If you don't want to host the images yourself, you can use
the script we've set up on our server:
UploadVisualChatPage="http://dev.mabinoger.com/visualchat/upload.php"

(3, optional)
The last step, if you want to host the images yourself, is to set up the PHP
upload script, found in "aura/web/visualchat". Now, I won't explain in detail
how to set up a web server here. So, just some guidelines:
- "upload.php" is the main script, that takes the images from the client. The
  URL to that file goes into "urls.xml".
- The script automatically tries to create a folder named "img" if it doesn't
  exist, where the images go. Don't forget this folder has to exist and be
  writable, or the upload script will silently fail, if it isn't able
  to create the folder itself.
- Probably the easiest way to make the script available from your web server
  is to make a symbolic link from it to Aura's "web" folder.
