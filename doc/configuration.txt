** User settings

Although all options can be freely changed in the main files
(e.g. conf/login.conf), in some cases it might be more comfortable to put
the user options into the sub-folder "user". The main files include their
counter parts (e.g. conf/user/login.conf), and the options get overwritten.
This way you don't have to worry about the main files changing when updating,
or when commiting changes to the SVN. Just create the user file, or copy the
main file, and put the options you need in there.

** Command line settings

Aside from the conf files, you can also define options on the command line,
these will overwrite the settings read from the files. You have all
features of the conf files here, so you can even include more files.
Note the quotation in the example though. Since arguments are split
by spaces, you'll have to use them on lines that have such.
The commands 'include' and 'require' are relative to the root folder (trunk)
when used from the command line for convincience, in case you want to include
files from other sub-folders for some reason.

Examples:
    WorldServer.exe world_servername=NotMartyr world_channelhost=Foo
    WorldServer.exe "include conf/world-channel1.conf"
    WorldServer.exe "world_servername = Name with spaces"

** Console filter

By default all messages are displayed in the console. The filter options are
bitmasks, which allow you to hide specific log messages. To specify more than
one, you simply add the values.

Values:
    Info          = 1
    Warning       = 2
    Error         = 4
    Debug         = 8
    Status        = 16
    Exception     = 32
    Unimplemented = 64

Examples:
    login_consolefilter = 0  // Display everything
    login_consolefilter = 4  // Hides debug messages
    login_consolefilter = 12 // Hides debug and error msgs, 4 + 8
